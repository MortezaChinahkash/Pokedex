/**
 * Main Pokemon application entry point
 * This file coordinates the overall application functionality
 */

// This file serves as the main coordinator for the Pokemon application
// All specific functionality has been modularized into separate files:
// - utils.js: Utility functions and helpers
// - pokemonData.js: Data management and API calls
// - rendering.js: Card and statistics rendering
// - overlay.js: Modal and overlay functionality
// - search.js: Search and theme management
// - HTMLTemplates.js: HTML template functions

/**
 * Application initialization
 * This is the main entry point that gets called when the page loads
 */


// The fetchUrls() function from pokemonData.js will be called by the onload event in index.html
// All other functions are event-driven through user interactions
